How to find open redirect?
  
  1. If the Applictaion have a user Sign-In/Sign-Up feature, then register a user and log in as the user.
  
  2. Go to your user profile page , for example : example.com/accounts/profile
  
  3. Copy the profile page's URL
  
  4. Logout and Clear all the cookies and go to the homepage of the site.
  
  5. Paste the Copied Profile URL on the address bar 
  
  6. If the site prompts for a login , check the address bar , you may find the login page with a redirect parameter like the following
        
    	- https://vuln.me/login?next=/accounts/profile
        - https://vuln.me/login?returnUrl=/accounts/profile
    
How to bypass it?
    
  1. https://vuln.me/login?next=https://vuln.me@evil.com ( due to bad regex )
  2. https://vuln.me/login?next=http://evil%E3%80%82com (  By using the character ã€‚ (%E3%80%82 url encoded) instead of a normal dot in urls, it is possible to bypass the blocking. )
    
    
Try to leverage it to XSS
    
   - https://vuln.me/login?next=javascript:alert(1);//
